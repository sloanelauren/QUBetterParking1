Welcome to QUBetterParking Simulator!

In this simulator we demonstrate how QU can improve their issues with on campus parking.

To establish this simulator the parking lot is empty. As students/faculty enter the parking lot they are given a ticket with a designated parking spot. As each person enters the parking lot an updated view of available spots are shown. When the lot is full the simulator informs the user that the lot is full. Finally, when students/faculty members are exiting the lot they return their tickets showing that spots are becoming available.
